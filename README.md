# ssnit-branches

**This branch is for development and testingâ€”all production builds of the app should only point to the master branch!**

A repo for the Realm database of SSNIT Branches used by SSNIT's mobile app.

This repo contains a folder of all of the SSNIT branch databases used, old and new, and a json file pointing the app to the most current one to update to.
